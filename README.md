Purpose:
Galactic star formation rates (SFR) estimated via SED fitting are not always reliable, thus making an empirical calculation can be warranted. This piece of code estimates the SFRs through UV magnitude using redshift and magnitude of each galaxy in various bands. The output file folder is assumed to be from CIGALE or in a similar format.
